# Embedded libc 

Embedded libc，a library which design for RTOS and Bare machines.

## Mlibc Architecture

+ Designed for resource-constrained devices
+ OpenSource
+ Especially for RISC-V..

## Code Catalogue



## Background



# Why we do

## Future

 ● mlibc can support multiple embedded tool-chains,it can be compiled by gcc(arm/risc-v)、even though LLVM compiler.

● Designed for resource-constrained devices，it can support some RTOS (RT-Thread) and Bare machines.

● It optimized for risc-v 32/64， have been specially adapted for RISC-V MCU

● It is is built by xmake or scons

● TODO



## Our plan



● QEMU/RISC-V 32GC can be used as a computer to putout "Hello word!" at first

● For Bare machines ,we push out especially mlibc sothat wecan accomplish crt.s，string and printf

● Basing on this environment,we will make mlibc perfectly.
